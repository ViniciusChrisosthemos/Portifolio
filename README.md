# Projects
## Virtual Museum

This project is a Virtual Reality application developed in Unity, designed to support the learning process of students with special educational needs, such as cerebral palsy, dyscalculia, and low vision. The experience recreates a virtual museum environment, inspired by the PUCRS Museum, where students can explore interactive exhibits in an immersive and engaging way.

Within the museum, each attraction presents math-focused activities tailored to teaching specific concepts. The activities include built-in tutorials to guide students step by step, making the content accessible and inclusive. By combining immersive VR technology with targeted educational design, the project aims to provide an innovative and supportive tool for enhancing mathematics learning.

## Virtual Bike

This project is a Virtual Reality application that simulates riding a bicycle using real-world sensors and a 3D environment built in Unity for the Meta Quest 3.

### How it Works

- Handlebar Control: A potentiometer is attached to the real bicycle’s handlebar axis using a custom 3D-printed mount. It captures steering movements and sends them to the virtual bicycle.

- Speed Tracking: A bicycle speedometer sensor with a magnet detects when the wheel completes one rotation. From this, the system calculates the current speed.

- Data Processing: Both steering and speed data are collected by a notebook, formatted, and transmitted to the Meta Quest 3 via Sockets.

- Virtual Simulation: Inside the VR headset, a Unity application simulates the 3D bicycle, updating its rotation and movement based on real sensor inputs.

The project combines hardware integration, real-time data streaming, and VR development to create a fun and immersive experience of riding a bicycle inside a virtual world.

## Machine maintenance training system using Virtual and Augmented Reality

A machine maintenance training system that utilizes Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to assemble and execute steps of a process.
The user can create or download sessions through their credentials located on their server and modify them via a JSON file or through the application itself.
Within a session, a control panel is used to navigate through the created steps and/or change the execution mode to Editing/Viewing.
In editing mode, a library of objects downloads asset bundles from a server and loads them into the application, allowing the user to position them in the environment.

The system was developed using the Unity Engine, in C#, for the Oculus Quest 2 platform.

## Game replay in Virtual Reality

An application for mobile devices that allows users to download football play replays from a server and watch them from different angles in Virtual Reality. The app enables users to download these plays (animated replay + video of the play), play it on the stadium's big screen, and view the play within the field of vision from predefined positions.

The application was developed using the Unity Engine, in C#, for the Android and iOS platforms.

## Positioning of Virtual Objects

An application that allows you to position virtual objects (football) in the environment. The App scans the surfaces of the environment and allows you to instantiate a list of objects, as well as move and delete them.

The Application was developed with Unity Engine, in C#, for the Android and IOS platforms.

## Instances of 3D objects in physical markers

An Augmented Reality application based on physical markers to instantiate 3D objects. The App contains a fixed set of available markers and a mechanism for linking 3D models with the markers. The 3D models are downloaded from the public repository of the GRV Virtual Reality Group, PUCRS, at this URL.

The Application was developed with Unity Engine, in C#, for the Android and IOS platforms.

## Tetris

The system was developed with the Unity Engine, in C#, for the WebGL platform.

## Video respiratory monitor

An application that detects a label and generates the distance between the points contained within it. This distance is used to measure the contraction of the abdomen of premature babies and identify their respiratory cycle status. The App automatically identifies the tag and defines a region of interest. Furthermore, the App allows you to record camera frames in a video to be analyzed in a graph later.

The system was developed in C++, for the Windows platform.

## Remote Assistance System in Augmented Reality

A system that allows the remote connection of a client application to the Oculus Quest and a Desktop server.
The client identifies a tag in the environment and records its point of view and sends the frames to the server, which visualizes it and instantiates virtual objects in the client's field of view.

## Simulator data viewer in Virtual Reality

A Virtual Reality application for visualizing data generated by the LODUS crowd simulator (https://repositorio.pucrs.br/dspace/handle/10923/20528).
The application allows you to visualize the behavior of groups of people moving from one region of interest to another.
The user can select regions to view the total number of healthy and infected people in the location, as well as their behavior throughout the simulation.
